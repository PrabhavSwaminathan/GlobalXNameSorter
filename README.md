# GlobalXNameSorter

This project was coded on Ubuntu Linux.

To test the project I added a sample text file with some names.

I used the following lines to execute the code

mcs -out:name-sorter.exe name-sorter.cs
mono name-sorter.exe unsorted-names-list.txt

This code is based on the following assumptions
A)No wrong input will be given
B)Every person has a last name 
C)No person has more than 3 given names
